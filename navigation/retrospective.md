## Retrospective Final Exam 


### 5 key things I did this trimester
- Learned how to deploy github pages by making my blog
- Learned how to use jupyter notebooks by creating lessons
- Created an item that extended on base code and learned javascript inheritance 
- Added an inventory to rpg game and learned to combine javascript and markdown
- I made the quiz check for correct answers in the RPG game and learned about how to compare arrays.

### RPG game tinkers
- I added an inventory
- I changed the movement
- I added an item that disapears once interacted with and allows player to check if the item has been collected
- Edited the quiz to check for correct answer and reward the player if answered correctly

#### Key points
- liked the pick up item feature + inventory
- add an ending once keys have been collected
- force player to talk to NPCs first
- make quests a little more complex

### Reflection and looking forward
- I was interested in Matthew's bathroom scanner, I thought it was cool how he managed to take the input from the card and then turn that into the time
