# Ideas for RPG game

Theme : 
Excape room a dungeon before you get caught
<br>
It is timed, so if you dont finish in a certain time peroid u restart  (do this if have time)
<br>
Player : will come up with later, idk find random player sprite
<br>
Background : a dark room.
<br>
<br>
NPC: Player interact with NPC, NPC give quests.
<br>

<br>
NPC1: makes player answer questions, if player answer correctly, u get the key
<Br>

NPC2: make player find an sword, return back to npc with spoon, to get the other key
<br>

NPC3: tells player that he needs to find two keys to escape and progress
<br>

item(spoon): Player interact with item, item disapear, set pickUpItem bool to true, then player interact with npc to continue to get an item.
<br>
<br>
Item(keys): The player needs two of these to progress to the enxt level, one from the quiz npc, one from the fetch quest npc
<br>
<br>
we wont add a sprite for this, just a notification that the player has obtained an item
<br>
<br>

exact sprites still undetermined but we have a general idea.
